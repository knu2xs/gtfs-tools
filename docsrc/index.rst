GTFS-Tools Documentation
*************************

GTFS-Tools arose out of a need for loading a *lot* of GTFS static datasets with the ability to flexibly add information
from the various tables included in a GTFS dataset. Since there is a *lot* of flexibility in the GTFS specification,
being able to get the information needed from a large variety of datasets requires flexibly handing the huge
variation in implementations. Hence, this Python package to make processing these datasets much easier.
